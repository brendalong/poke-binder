# Poke-Binder

Simple application for viewing Pokemon by original region.

Initially developed as a project for Invention Convention at Lipscomb Academy with project requirements and UI/UX determined by a 3rd grader.

## Challenge
Client (3rd grader) expressed challenge with Pokemon websites because they were too complicated and could not view Pokemon by original region.  Client express not having a login since most kids her age don't have an email address. **Update** After testing with users and realizing all users cards were displayed, client expressed need for individual logins. Client felt kids could use parent emails if necessary.

## Project objectives
Sort Pokemon by region, view a large image of Pokemon, view all trading cards related to a Pokemon with option to mark as caught with a notes area, viewable on tablet devices.

## Workflow
During a two weekend sprint, learned alot about Pokemon. Collected Pokemon data from various sources. Sorted and uploaded data to fit project requirements. Used Google Firebase to host data. Created website with React. Client also assisted with testing and trouble shooting data.

## Conclusion
Client was very happy with the end result, as well as her friends. After testing the app with other users, client would like to expand and include a login so everyone can collect their own cards with ability to view only the ones collected.

## Technologies
React, Bootstrap, and Firebase with Rebase
